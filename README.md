# Le Blog : Projet 5

This is my professional blog

## Installing project

1.  Clone or Download project

2.  Put the folder 'project_5' to the root of your localhost

3.  Once ```composer``` is installed. Open your terminal, go to ```yourLocalhostDirectory/Projet_5``` and type ````composer install````. This command will install all composer's dependencies

4.  Import the blog.db file in your database

5.  Configure the database infos in [this file](config/dev.php)

6.  Configure the mail infos [here](config/Mail.php) (I recommend to use [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/) to test sending mails locally)

7.  Write 'localhost/projet_5/public' in the address bar of your favorite browser and press enter
